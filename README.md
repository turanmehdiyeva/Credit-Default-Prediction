# Data Cleaning
- made it readible in Python which was previously prepared in R language
- filled missing variables
- made variables and columns follow the same naming convention
# EDA
- I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.

# Model Building
First, I transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables with the help of DictVectorizer. I also split the data into train, tests and validation sets with a test size of 20%.

I tried three different models and evaluated them with roc_auc_score. I chose roc_auc_score because it is relatively easy to understand and correct observation about the model.

I tried three different models:

- Logistic Regression: roc_auc_score = 0.60 (overfitting)
- Decision Tree Classifier: roc_auc_score = 0.75
- Random Forest: roc_auc_score = 0.78
